2.2.3

- Fixed issue where drag and drop of direct APK files would cause Loader to repeatedly claim an install had failed, even though it succeeded.

2.2.2

- Fixed code used to force close rclone. This will fix a myriad of issues including automatic reinstall when an install fails, errant cases of the all mirrors are at quota message, downloads failing to start/getting stuck, etc.

- Fixed automatic donations.

- Added ETA, upload speed, and progress bar to uploads.

- Added 10 second timer that will swap between download and upload speed/progress/eta if currently doing both simultaneously.
