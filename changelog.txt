Loader 2.1.4

- If user exits while Loader is busy and they choose to abort the shutdown Loader will no longer just shutdown anyway.

- Updated ADB to latest version (AGAIN)

- Fixed issue where installing gif was not always animating.

- Clicking installing gif will reveal Device ID as well now.

- Output of advanced restore has been cleaned up.

- Fixed multiple issues with Advanced Backups including:
1) If user set backup location to a removable drive and then removes the drive before next backup Loader will no longer crash.
2) Backing up the same game twice in one day no longer causes a crash.
3) Doing a full game backup no longer creates empty folders in Auto-Backups.
4) Empty save folders and empty folders in any backup folder will now be automatically removed.
5) GB Counter for sideloaded games being backed up was not set to visible.
6) GB Count was always starting at 28GB due to a design test being left in the release build.
