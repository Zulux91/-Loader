2.0.12

- ADB Update. This is a critical update if you'd like your installs to go properly.

This is the first time ADB was updated since August 2021. 

Required update unless you like conflicts with other ADB's that can even completely break Loader. Of course this had to come after 1019432 other updates!  Sorry guys but I'd recommend this one for stability. Like I said they rarely update it. 

In fact the last time it was updated I was still the lead developer of Rookie!
