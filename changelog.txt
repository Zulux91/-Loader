Loader 3.1

-Added special update script to repo and to Loader launch 
that will automatically check for and obtain latest ADB and 
add it to system path!

-Trailers/Icons will now properly change while using search.

-Swapped RestSharp(used to get mirror down info for faster boot) f
or HTML Request, could possibly fix SSL errors.

-Added window resizing functionality.

-Added maximize button.

-Added font size option in settings.

-Plugging in your Quest while Loader is already open will now properly 
ncheck No Device mode unless you had manually turned it on while a Quest 
was connected during this session.

-Made Tool Tips much larger and made them come up almost instantly, 
to counterbalance this fact I added a check box to disable them in the t
op right corner of Loader.

-Fixed missing ToolTips from the Settings page.
