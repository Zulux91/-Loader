Loader v2.0.6

OK So I must admit, I felt really bad for all the different version numbers. I felt bad for the amazing and really cool people who said it's no big deal, those who continued to stick with us in chate and fulfill all of my crazy requests to try to get to the bottom of this. Hopefully this one is the one that fixes 99.9% of the user base's WMP issues.

Thanks for sticking with us through all of the troubleshooting, y'all real ones.

So I of course couldn't come to you with just another boring fix. I decided to spend the last 11 hours maniacally working on the Sort By Popularity feature. Now it IS still in its infancy. We just started tracking downloads 2 days ago but we already have some interesting data and it will only get better over time! Eventually we will add options where you can choose what time frame to sort by, so stay tuned for that! These stats are only measured on 2.0.4 and up so if you want your fav games to be played more, gotta update. The more people we represent with this the more we know where to focus the team's efforts! Thanks again!
