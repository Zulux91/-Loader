LOADER v2

Backups/Restores
• Rebuilt backup function from the ground up. Users will now see a list of their installed apps where they can define which apps they want to back up.
• Users can now make full backups of installed apps (including the app files, saves are always backed up by default).
• Rebuilt restore function to parse the full app backups when necessary. This will reinstall the app to the exact same condition it was when it was backed up.
• Added size estimate for full app backup since this is more storage intensive.
• Added option to uninstall app after backing up (full or saves only).
• Added option to clear any OBBs from apps that are not currently installed.
• Rebuilt restore to handle installing full backups automatically.
• Backup process will signal roughly how many GB are left to backup and how many apps are remaining as well.

QOL
• Added shortcuts (F8 or CTRL+S) and a button in Loader's settings menu to access hidden android system settings.
• Added offline mode for when all mirrors are at quota.
• Added Auto Update All button - when user clicks this any apps that are out of date on their device will be automatically downloaded and installed!
