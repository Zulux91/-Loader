**AIO Updates:**
**Shortcut Maker is now known as VRL which stands for VR Launcher**.
This new PCVR helper program will create batch files with the proper
parameters for VD or Link/AirLink to work properly. With improved 
automatic search it will find a shipping exe if one exists (required for some
games to launch in VR/not in flat mode). Then VRL will put the batch files
into a tidy EXE file, using the icon of the originally found game's exe,
The final thing VRL will then do is automatically send a shortcut to your start
menu folder (which is tucked away in AppData\Roaming), this is so they can be
found by Steam instantly upon clicking "Manually add non-steam game exe"
Shortcut Maker only made bat files, which Steam does not allow.
