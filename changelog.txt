LOADER
v2.0.15

-OK I know what you're thinking, 2 updates in one day?! This is getting ridiculous! Well you guys with your bizarre systems keep finding new crashes. This time it was another serious one that would crash Loader completely during drag+drop installs! Now leave me alone! Please! (jk...mostly)

----------------------------------------------------------

LOADER
v2.0.14

-Fixed somewhat rare but program breaking bug with ADB that caused Loader to get stuck on a black screen on launch.

----------------------------------------------------------

v2.0.13

-Added code to deal with failed downloads. Now Loader will move on to the next item in the list if there is no APK file in the game folder.

-Fixed 7z.exe and 7z.dll error to be more accurate. 

-Added proper ADB process kill to program launch.

-Upgraded aapt to aapt2, should fix any naming issues with donations and obb install issues with drag+drop installs.

-Fixed error that caused MetaData to be parsed every single time, now Loader will boot much faster on any consecutive startups within a 24 hour period.

-Changed "Downloads" sort category to "Popularity" and it is now always based on the past 7 days, this is because the previous method would keep growing until Loader took 30 minutes to launch. This gives it a clean cutoff so bootup doesnt take exponentially longer.

-Fixed many crashes related to ADB.

-(Hopefully) fixed rare bug where errant app donations were asked for.
