Loader v2.2.5

- Reintegrated/cleaned up nested drag drops. Users can once again drag+drop folders of game folders.

- Users can now drag+drop either data folder or date of backup folder to restore Saves-Only backups.

- Added code that will properly skip rclone commands if internet is down. This should, in theory, finally allow an offline mode (although it remains untested).

- Fixed quota issue happening due to game library or popularity data being at quota.

- Switched TaskKill to WMIC for rclone kill and adb kill since it doesn't require administrator privileges to end tasks.

- Added animation that signals Loader update is taking place.

- Fixed issue where Loader updates were not working due to timer being too short for older machines.

- Fixed Advanced Restore for Saves-Only backups.
