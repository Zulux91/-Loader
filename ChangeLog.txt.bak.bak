LOADER v2.0.1

-Added framework to update trailers via Rclone going forward. 
Note: In order to enable the video trailers you are REQUIRED
to install the latest FFAIO package. Once it is installed your
trailer library will continually update over time as
new games/updates become available. Installing the latest FFAIO
package will also upgrade your mirrors for both Loader AND 
FFA_GUI!

-Fixed issue with new persistent settings system, a great deal of
crashes should stop happening as a direct result. 

-Fixing this issue has also entirely repaired Wireless ADB mode.
(it was indeed completely broken).

-Fixed v140 of SuperHot triggering the AutoUpdate.

-Added fix for Winrar VS 7z.exe errors to FFAIO!! These errors would 
occur when trying to share/extract apps to upload and/or when installing 
special games like Beat Saber + BMBF, Blade & Sorcery + Mods, Sniper
Elite, + anything else with an Install.txt! FFAIO is required for this
fix since it is fixed by using the FFAIO Inno Setup script to add
7z to user's System Path which thankfully means users will no longer need
to uninstall WinRAR to fix this! Yay!

-Fixed 8 Errant trailers. FFMPEG went a little nuts while converting 
the trailers so if you notice any that do not match the selected game
please let a Mod/Founder know in FFA Help! Thank you!
